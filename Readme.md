## Candidate: Vanshika Arora

This folder contains all required files and components for the Oxford DataPlan technical task.

---

## ðŸ”½ What to Download

 The entire folder  contains the following:

* `main.ipynb` â€“ Interactive notebook with all code, outputs, and visualizations.
* `Revenue Index Prediction Write-up.pdf` â€“ Detailed explanation of methodology, feature engineering, and evaluation.
* `data_task.xlsx` â€“ The original data file provided in the task.

You can open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.

## âœ… Notes

* All plots are embedded inside the notebook.
* Model was trained up to 2022 Q3 and evaluated on 2022 Q4 only.
* Total of 19 data points used for training.
* Revenue index was predicted in line with task expectations.
* No `pip install` commands are included to avoid installation errors. If the models fail to run, please ensure the following libraries are available in your environment:

  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `seaborn`
  * `scikit-learn`
  * `openpyxl` (for reading `.xlsx` files)
  * `datetime` (Python built-in)
  * `warnings` (Python built-in)
